Report:

Application Purpose:
This Application was created so that it could be used as a popular study tool to test the users knowledge on various subjects in this case history,
it was also kept in mind to be fun and competitive by adding score and feedback for the user to do better the next time they play.

Application Code Explanation:
The application starts up first showing the user the start screen where they are greated and given a short explanation of the application and its purpose
there after the user clicks the start button and is taken to the second screen where the user answers questions 1 by 1 by either clicking on the true or false buttons where there then will appear a small message saying correct or incorrect.
Then clicking the next button in order to get the next question after all questions are answered the user can click the Score screen button which then takes the user to the score screen.
This screen then displays the score the user got out of 5. The user then has 2 options either exit the application or review the answers. If the user clicks exit the application closes. If the user
clicks Review the application takes the user to the review screen where each question is listed and answer is given. Then the only option is left is for the user to click the exit button provided on the reviw screen. 

Detail:
In consideration of the design of the application I've chosen to keep it simple and plain this is just my preference.
I've made the background a darkish blue made the text bigger for the user to read, given the buttons color based on the
majority of the button color used in other applications and then gave the output text in the middle of the screen. All text was given the same font.

Why Github:
I've chosen GitHub and GitHub actions for their ease of access and professionalism in documentation and storages of files as my place of frequent commits and place to keep the code in a professional format.
